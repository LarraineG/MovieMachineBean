## The Team

* Team members: Angela Keys, Calum Held, Larraine Gonzales and Chloe Perkins.

## Requirements

* Must use a ReactJS
* Must use Node and Express Web Server
* Must be backed by a MySQL or MonoDb database with a Sequelize or Mongoose ORM
* Must utilize both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
* Must be deployed using Heroku (with data)
* Must utilize at least two new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed
* Must have a polished front end/UI
* Must have an authenticator for users
* Must have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
* Must protect API keys in Node with environment variables

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
